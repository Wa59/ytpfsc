# YouTube Parser for Slow Computers
A way to get content from YouTube videos in really old computers. It downloads the video and converts it into a simple page that contains some stills from the video as well as the captions so you can read what the content was. This scripts run in a modern web server and older computers with no support for the modern web can use it to see what an YouTube video is all about.

You need to have both the youtube-dl and ffmpeg binaries in the same folder as the script for it to work.
